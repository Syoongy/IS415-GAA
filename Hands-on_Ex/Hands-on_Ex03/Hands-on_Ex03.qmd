# 1st order
Spatial Point Pattern Analysis is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution, of a set of points on a surface. The point can represent events such as crime, traffic accident and disease onset, or business services (coffee and fastfood outlets) or facilities such as childcare and eldercare.

We will be using `spatstat` on this exercise to discover the spatial point processes of childecare centres in Singapore.
